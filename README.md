## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was my first project where I really started to get into front-end development. Throughout this process the designs became more complex as I learned how to execute them from a technical standpoint. I started this project barely knowing the difference between a section and a div tag and I had no idea how absolute positioning worked.

## Optimizations

Created gifs of highlighted project pages and implemented a modal for optimal viewing. On Henrys Space Odyssey's page I implemented a portion of the API to preview the most current Astrological Picture of the Day.

## Lessons Learned:

By the end of this project I had learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and various best practices such as OOP. I implemented a modal from one of my other projects, expanding its usability to four images instead of just one. I learned about async/await as well as promises and how to retreive information from API's. I also used this project to get a better handle on CSS and mobile-first responsive techniques, and as a result the website is completely responsive and mobile friendly.
